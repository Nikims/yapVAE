# yapVAE
This project lets you build and train a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using your webcam. It's all about experimenting with machine learning right in your browser.

Features
Capture images directly from the webcam.
Customize and build your own VAE model structure.
Train the model or interrupt training anytime.
Real-time transformations with a live mode.
Save and load trained models for later use.
Quick Start
Set the resolution for your images.
Capture webcam snapshots.
Customize layers and build your model.
Train the VAE, explore its latent space, and tweak as you go.
Enable live mode for real-time effects.
Tools
Built with TensorFlow.js, JavaScript, and a bit of HTML/CSS.

That's it. Experiment, adjust, and see what happens.
